Leader configuration
====================

A minimal AtlasDB configuration for the leader block will look like :

.. code-block:: yaml

  leader:
    # This should be at least half the number of nodes in your cluster
    quorumSize: 2
    learnerLogDir: var/data/paxosLogs
    acceptorLogDir: var/data/paxosLogs
    # This should be different for every node. If ssl is not enabled, then the host must be specified as http
    localServer: https://<yourhost>:3828
    # This should be the same for every node. If ssl is not enabled, then the host must be specified as http
    lockCreator: https://host1:3828
    # This should be the same for every node
    leaders:
      - https://host1:3828 # If ssl is not enabled, then the hosts must be specified as http
      - https://host2:3828
      - https://host3:3828

Leader
======

The leader block is where you specify the leaders (all hosts that participate in leader election) for paxos and a lockCreator for creating the schema mutation lock table.

Required parameters:

- ``quorumSize`` : Number of hosts that form a majority. This number must be greater than half of the total number of hosts.
- ``leaders`` : A list of all hosts. The protocol must be http/https depending on if ssl is configured.
- ``localhost`` : The ``protocol://hostname:port`` eg: ``https://myhost:3828`` of the host on which this config exists.

Optional parameters:

- ``learnerLogDir`` : Path to the paxos learner logs (defaults to var/data/paxos/learner)
- ``acceptorLogDir`` : Path to the paxos acceptor logs (defaults to var/data/paxos/acceptor)
- ``lockCreator`` : The host responsible for creation of the schema mutation lock table. If specified, this must be same across all hosts. (defaults to the first host in the sorted leaders list)
- ``pingRateMs`` : defaults to 5000
- ``randomWaitBeforeProposingLeadershipMs`` : defaults to 1000
- ``leaderPingResponseWaitMs`` : defaults to 5000
