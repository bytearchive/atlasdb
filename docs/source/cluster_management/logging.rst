Profiling a Key Value Service
=============================

All Key Value Services created using ``TransactionManagers.create()`` will
be wrapped in a ``ProfilingKeyValueService``.  This service will log out timing
and metadata for requests made against the underlying KVS.  In order to activate
the logging, simply enable ``TRACE`` logging for
``com.palantir.atlasdb.keyvalue.impl.ProfilingKeyValueService``.

If you are using ``CassandraKeyValueService``, you can use additional tracing for deeper analysis.
For more information, see :ref:`enabling-cassandra-tracing`.
